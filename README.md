<h1 id="how-to-play">üéÆ How to play</h1>

First of all, you'll need to clone the repo and go to the project file. You can do this using this command line:
```
~$ git clone git@github.com:joaorodrs/professional-finding.git

~$ cd professional-finding
```
Or if you already have the project in your drive, just proceed to the next steps.

There's two setups that you'll need to do to fully setup the application.

<h2 id="htp-back-end">üì° Back-end</h2>

1. You'll need to go to the back-end directory, this way:
```
~/professional-finding$ cd server
```
2. And then you can install the dependencies with: `npm i` or `yarn`

3. You now can run the tests, to see if all is going well. Run this command:
```
~/professional-finding/server$ npm test // or yarn test
```
If something goes wrong on the tests, you can go on my Discord (<b>Jo√£o Paulo#0735</b>) or Twitter (in my GitHub profile), but first make sure that all is right with the setup until now.

6. If everything is fine, then you can just run:
```
~/professional-finding/server$ npm run dev // or yarn dev
```
7. You can also run the project in a docker container, running:
```
~/professional-finding/server$ docker-compose up
```
Both commands (6 and 7) will run the development server at `http://localhost:3333`, but the docker one will run a PostgreSQL database and the other will run a local database that can be found in `./src/database/dev.sqlite`.

<h2 id="htp-front-end">üåê Front-end</h2>

1. Switch up to the front-end folder using:
```
~/professional-finding/server$ cd ../frontend
```
1. Just install the dependencies by using `npm i` or `yarn`
2. And then run the project in development with:
```
~/professional-finding/frontend$ npm start // or yarn start
```
The front-end will be running in http://localhost:3000

### That's it! Now, with both back-end and front-end servers running (localhost:3333 and localhost:3000), you can see all the functionalities.
